# smooth-parallax

Parallax effect that doesn't suck! Smooth parallax is intended to make it a lot easier to move objects on scroll (vertically or horizontally), being it images, divs or what-have-you.

Use it to add that background or foreground parallax effect to your website.


## Install

Install Smooth Parallax in your project via `npm` or `bower`

*npm*
```
npm install smooth-parallax
```

*bower*
```
bower install smooth-parallax
```

## Build

NOTE: As a prerequisite, you will need [npm](https://npmjs.com/) and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed: `npm install -g gulp`

```
npm install
gulp build-scripts
```

During development you can have gulp watch the `src` directory for changes and automatically build the `dist` files by running:

```
gulp
```
